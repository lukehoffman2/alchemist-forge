# Alchemist Forge: Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of improvements for the Alchemist Forge project. Each task is designed to enhance code quality, performance, user experience, or maintainability.

## Code Organization

[x] 1. Refactor the monolithic game.html into separate files:
   - [x] Extract CSS into a dedicated stylesheet
   - [x] Move JavaScript game logic to separate .js files
   - [x] Organize code into logical modules (rendering, game mechanics, UI, etc.)

[x] 2. Implement proper ES6 module structure:
   - [x] Create class-based architecture for game components
   - [x] Use import/export statements for dependencies
   - [x] Separate game state from rendering logic

[ ] 3. Create a proper asset management system:
   - [ ] Move 3D models and materials to dedicated files/folders
   - [ ] Implement asset preloading with progress indicators
   - [ ] Add proper resource cleanup when assets are no longer needed

## Performance Optimization

[ ] 4. Optimize rendering performance:
   - [ ] Implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
   - [ ] Use instanced rendering for similar objects (trees, ores)
   - [ ] Add level-of-detail (LOD) for distant objects

[ ] 5. Improve memory management:
   - [ ] Properly dispose of Three.js objects when no longer needed
   - [ ] Implement texture compression and size optimization
   - [ ] Add frame rate limiting options to reduce power consumption

[ ] 6. Optimize game loop:
   - [ ] Use requestAnimationFrame more efficiently
   - [ ] Implement fixed time step for physics/game logic
   - [ ] Separate update loops for different systems based on required frequency

## User Experience

[ ] 7. Enhance game controls and accessibility:
   - [ ] Add controller support
   - [ ] Implement customizable keybindings
   - [ ] Add accessibility features (text scaling, color blindness support)

[ ] 8. Improve visual feedback:
   - [ ] Add particle effects for mining/chopping/smelting
   - [ ] Implement smooth transitions between game states
   - [ ] Add visual indicators for interaction zones

[ ] 9. Enhance UI/UX:
   - [ ] Create a proper tutorial system
   - [ ] Implement a settings menu
   - [ ] Add save/load game functionality
   - [ ] Design a more intuitive inventory management system

## Security and Best Practices

[ ] 10. Address security concerns:
    - [ ] Move API keys to environment variables or server-side
    - [ ] Implement proper error handling for API requests
    - [ ] Add input validation for all user inputs

[ ] 11. Implement modern JavaScript practices:
    - [ ] Use const/let instead of var
    - [ ] Implement proper async/await patterns for asynchronous operations
    - [ ] Add comprehensive error handling throughout the codebase

[ ] 12. Add proper documentation:
    - [ ] Add JSDoc comments for all functions and classes
    - [ ] Create a project README with setup instructions
    - [ ] Document the game architecture and design decisions

## Testing and Quality Assurance

[ ] 13. Implement automated testing:
    - [ ] Set up unit tests for core game logic
    - [ ] Add integration tests for game systems
    - [ ] Implement performance benchmarking

[ ] 14. Add development tools:
    - [ ] Create a debug mode with performance metrics
    - [ ] Implement a scene inspector for development
    - [ ] Add logging system for easier debugging

## Feature Enhancements

[ ] 15. Expand game mechanics:
    - [ ] Add crafting system for creating tools and items
    - [ ] Implement a progression system with unlockable content
    - [ ] Add more resource types and collectibles

[ ] 16. Enhance world generation:
    - [ ] Create procedurally generated terrain
    - [ ] Add different biomes with unique resources
    - [ ] Implement day/night cycle with lighting changes

[ ] 17. Add multiplayer capabilities:
    - [ ] Implement basic networking infrastructure
    - [ ] Add cooperative gameplay features
    - [ ] Create shared world persistence

## Mobile Support

[ ] 18. Optimize for mobile devices:
    - [ ] Implement responsive design for different screen sizes
    - [ ] Add touch controls for mobile gameplay
    - [ ] Optimize performance for mobile hardware limitations
